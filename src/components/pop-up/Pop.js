     <strong>Gene</strong>: This is the basic unit of heredity. Its
     biochemical nature is a defined stretch of sequentially organized
     Deoxyribonu- cleotidyl Acid (DNA).

   <p class="m-3">
     <strong>Variation</strong>: This refers to the differences in
     Sequential organization of DNA bases from a reference database.

     <strong>Zygosity</strong>: Human is diploid. This means that every
     human has 2 copies of genetic Material (DNA), one from the mother
     and one from the father. Zygosity refers to any differences in DNA
     between these two copies. No difference is Homozygous; Any
     difference Is refereed to as heterozygous.

     <strong>Variant Classification</strong>: This is a call out of the
     consequence of a change in DNA to the function of the gene and how
     it may be evaluated vis-Ã -vis an individuals health.
