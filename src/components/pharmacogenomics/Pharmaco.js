        <p className="c2">Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is a field of research that studies how a personâ€™s genes affect how he or she responds to medications. Its long-term goal is to help doctors select the drugs and doses best suited for each person.</p>

      <h2>Facts</h2>
      <ul className="pharma-list">
        <li>90-99% of the population has at least one actionable variant in an established pharmacogenomics (PGx) gene.</li>

<li>An estimated 64.8% of medical home patients in the United States would have been exposed to a medication with a known PGx-association within a 5 year period.</li>

<li>Variations in PGx genes can influence the absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or excretion of certain medications, leading to variations in efficacy or risk of side-effects.</li>
